# Grabby
Grabby is a multi-connection usenet binary grabber.

Grabby is under active development, and not ready for use. In its current form
it will use multiple connections to download and yEnc decode the segments of an
NZB file from a single Usenet server. It does not yet handle assembly, or any
post processing.
